# Travel-VPN (In Progress)

 This project was high on my priority list of projects to start first, solely due to the fact that I would like to be access my locally hosted media while on the road.

# Initial Steps
 1. Removed MicroSD card from Raspberry Pi 4 and inserted it into a card reader connected to my computer running NixOS Linux.
 2. Installed the Raspberry Pi Imager; this utility allows the user to put a variety of distributions of Linux on to the SD card with relative ease.
 3. For this project, I chose Ubuntu due to its user friendly features. The imager already had the ISO ready, I just needed to choose the destination!
 4. Followed all the on screen prompts so that I could find out the IP address and ssh from my Windows machine where I would finish the remainder of the project.

# First Roadblock

 This is where I ran into my first speed bump. I use Solar-PuTTY to ssh from my Windows machine to my aforementioned Linux workstation and eventually the Pi as well. It had been a while since I set up my initial ssh session with my Linux setup but I remembered it working relatively easily.
